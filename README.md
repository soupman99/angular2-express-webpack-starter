git clone https://github.com/soupman99/angular2-express-webpack-starter.git
npm install && npm start
```

Starts a concurrent express server & creates a webpack proxy so can you call directly to the backend from the same port:
`http://localhost:3000/api/public/simple` 


**That's it! - You're done.**
